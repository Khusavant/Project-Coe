        <h2>Origin of Holi</h2>
        <p>Holi is an ancient Hindu festival that dates back to the 4th century. It has been mentioned in religious texts such as the Puranas and even in old Sanskrit poetry.</p>

        <h2>Mythological Stories Behind Holi</h2>

        <div class="story">
            <h3>🔥 The Legend of Prahlad and Holika</h3>
            <p>Holi is associated with the story of Prahlad, a devotee of Lord Vishnu, and his tyrannical father, King Hiranyakashipu. The king wanted everyone to worship him instead of the gods, but Prahlad refused. Enraged, the king ordered his sister Holika, who was immune to fire, to sit in flames with Prahlad in her lap. However, due to divine intervention, Holika burned while Prahlad was unharmed. This event symbolizes the victory of good over evil.</p>

            <p>Another popular story behind Holi is related to Lord Krishna, who playfully applied colors to his beloved Radha’s face. This tradition evolved into the joyous color-throwing festival we celebrate today.</p>

            <h3>👑 The Legend of Kamadeva</h3>
            <p>In Southern India, Holi is linked to Kamadeva, the god of love, who tried to awaken Lord Shiva from deep meditation. In anger, Shiva opened his third eye and burned Kamadeva. Later, seeing Kamadeva’s wife Rati’s grief, Shiva revived him, making Holi a festival of love and devotion.</p>
